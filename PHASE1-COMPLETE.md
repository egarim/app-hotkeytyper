## Key Features Implemented

- **Hierarchical Data Model:** AppConfiguration → SnippetSet → Snippet
- **GUID-Based IDs:** Unique identification for all entities
- **Hotkey Management:** Up to 9 snippets per set (Ctrl+Shift+1-9)
- **Conflict Detection:** Prevents duplicate hotkey assignments
- **Validation System:** Comprehensive error checking with messages
- **Migration Logic:** Automatic upgrade from V1 to V2 format
- **Backup System:** Auto-backup before every save
- **AppData Storage:** Windows best practice (LocalApplicationData)
- **Import/Export:** Manual backup and restore support

## Storage Details

**Location:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HotkeyTyper\`  
**Main File:** `settings.json`  
**Backup File:** `settings.backup.json`  
**Old Location:** `<app_directory>\settings.json` (auto-migrated)

**JSON Format (V2):**
```json
{
  "settingsVersion": 2,
  "activeSetId": "guid-here",
  "minimizeToTray": false,
  "sets": [
    {
      "id": "guid-here",
      "name": "Set Name",
      "description": "Description",
      "colorHex": "#4285F4",
      "iconName": "icon-name",
      "snippets": [
        {
          "id": "guid-here",
          "name": "Snippet Name",
          "content": "Text content",
          "hotkeyNumber": 1,
          "typingSpeed": 10,
          "hasCode": false,
          "useFile": false,
          "filePath": null
        }
      ]
    }

## Build Verification

**Command:** `.\verify-phase1.ps1`

**Results:**
- ✓ Build: SUCCESS
- ✓ Assembly: 52 KB
- ✓ Source files: 4/4 verified
- ✓ Total lines: 949

---

## Testing Instructions

### For Developer

1. Run verification script:
   ```powershell
   .\verify-phase1.ps1
   ```

2. Launch application:
   ```powershell
   cd HotkeyTyper
   dotnet run
   ```

3. Check settings file:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\HotkeyTyper\settings.json"
   ```

### For End User

See `TESTING-PHASE1.md` for detailed testing guide.

## Known Limitations (Expected for Phase 1)

These are **by design** and will be addressed in Phase 2:

- ❌ UI doesn't use new data layer yet (still uses old code)
- ❌ Settings file created but not loaded by UI
- ❌ Hotkeys not registered from new sets
- ❌ No UI for managing sets/snippets yet

**This is intentional!** Phase 1 is data foundation only.

---

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Name Conflict Resolution
**Problem:** Existing `AppSettings` class in `Form1.cs`  
**Solution:** Renamed new class to `AppConfiguration`  
**Impact:** Clear separation, backward compatible

### 2. Migration Strategy
**Problem:** Need to support old single-text format  
**Solution:** Keep old `AppSettings` class, use it for deserialization during migration  
**Impact:** Seamless upgrade path for existing users

### 3. Storage Location
**Problem:** Old version saved to app directory (permission issues)  
**Solution:** Move to `%LOCALAPPDATA%` with auto-migration  
**Impact:** Better Windows compliance, no admin rights needed

### 4. Validation Approach
**Problem:** Need to catch errors before saving  
**Solution:** `IsValid(out errorMessage)` pattern on all classes  
**Impact:** Clear error reporting, prevents corrupt data

## Next Steps: Phase 2

**Title:** Basic UI - Sets Panel  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

**Deliverables:**
1. Three-panel layout (Sets | Snippets | Editor)
2. Sets ListBox with selection
3. New/Delete/Rename set buttons
4. Integration with SettingsManager
5. Load settings on startup
6. Save on changes

**Files to Modify:**
- `Form1.Designer.cs` - Add SplitContainer, sets panel
- `Form1.cs` - Wire up data layer, event handlers

**No new data classes needed** - Phase 1 provided everything!
