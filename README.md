# Hotkey Typer

A tiny Windows Forms utility that types a predefined block of text into the currently focused application using a global hotkey. It's perfect for demos, tutorials, or any workflow where you need to reproduce long prompts quickly and naturally.

Key features:

- Global hotkey (default: CTRL+SHIFT+1)
- Human-like typing with randomized delays
- Persistent settings stored in `settings.json`
- System tray integration for unobtrusive background operation
	- Hotkey now remains active after minimizing to tray (handle recreation is auto-handled)
 - Custom in-memory tray & window icon (no external .ico file required)
	- First run exports `HotkeyTyper.ico` beside the executable so you can replace it and set as `<ApplicationIcon>` if desired

Repository:

https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/app-hotkeytyper

Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- .NET SDK (10.0 or later)

Clone, build, and run (PowerShell):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/app-hotkeytyper.git
cd app-hotkeytyper/HotkeyTyper
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Usage

1. Start the app (see above).
2. Enter your desired text in the main window and click "Update Text" to save.
3. Switch to any application and press CTRL+SHIFT+1 to have Hotkey Typer type the configured snippet.
4. Minimize to tray to keep the app running in the background.
	- The global hotkey remains active even after minimizing or toggling taskbar visibility.

Notes

- Some applications or elevated processes may block automated input; run Hotkey Typer with matching elevation if needed.
- Because the app simulates keystrokes, security tools may flag it. Only run it in trusted environments.
 - The tray + taskbar icon is generated at runtime (see `IconFactory.cs`). To supply your own static icon, add an .ico file to the project and set `<ApplicationIcon>YourIcon.ico</ApplicationIcon>` in the csproj, then assign it to the tray `NotifyIcon` in `Form1`.
 - A copy of the generated icon is saved as `HotkeyTyper.ico` (only if the file does not already exist) for convenience.

## Typing source code & special characters

Hotkey Typer uses `SendKeys` under the hood. Certain characters have special meaning in `SendKeys` ( `+ ^ % ~ ( ) { }` ).
Previously, entering raw C# (e.g. `public void Concat<T>(params ReadOnlySpan<T> items)`) could trigger the runtime error:

```
Group delimiters are not balanced.
```

This happened because parentheses are grouping delimiters in `SendKeys` and must be escaped to be typed literally.

The app now automatically escapes these characters for you. You can paste or type source code containing:

- Parentheses: `(` `)`
- Braces: `{` `}`
- Plus / caret / percent / tilde: `+ ^ % ~`
- Tabs and newlines (converted to real Tab / Enter key presses)

If you notice any character that still fails to type correctly, open an issue with the exact snippet.

See `blogs/announce-hotkeytyper.md` for a longer announcement and implementation notes.
